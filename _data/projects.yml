    This project aims to provide an R interface to Ideogram.js, integrate it with bioconductor infrastructures and possibly provide an interactive whole-genome exploring tool combining with other visualization components.

    Ideogram.js is a JavaScript library for chromosome visualization. It can be used for interactive visualization of chromosomes of different species, showing cytobands, showing annotations along the chromosomes, showing position mapping (e.g. homology) between different chromosomes, etc.
